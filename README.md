### ABOUT ME
I‚Äôm interested in a career in Data Science.  I have a M.S. in Biostatistics and was a Ph.D. Candidate in Biostatistics.  Much of my education was applied statistical and biostatistical techniques and methodology performed in R and SAS. Analysis included machine learning techniques of decision trees, penalized regression, cluster analysis, Kth Nearest Neighbors, and Principal Components Analysis.  I also have experience performing survival analysis.  I am updating my skillset using Python.

I‚Äôm currently learning as much as I can possibly learn. I have taken several courses through DataCamp.  I‚Äôm looking for a Data Science or statistical position. I love being in the data. üíûÔ∏è
